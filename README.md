# Web-Scraping-NY-Times-Nonfictional-Bestsellers-Part-1
This code will web scrap the NY Times's bestsellers list for every week within a year, specifically 2020. However, the year can be changed to any desired year, and this script will collect the nonfictional bestsellers from the NY Times with Python within Jupyter Notebook.
Part 2 will unpickle the data so that linguistic analyses can be done over the synopsis for each book.
