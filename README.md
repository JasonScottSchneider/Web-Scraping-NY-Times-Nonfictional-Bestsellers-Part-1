# Web-Scraping-NY-Times-Nonfictional-Bestsellers-Part-1
This code will web scrap the NY Times's bestsellers list for every week within a year, specifically 2020. However, the year can be changed to any desired year, and this script will collect the nonfictional bestsellers from the NY Times with Python within Jupyter Notebook. A folder named stored_data is included, but not necessary to use the script, so that data can be viewed for what the script should be able to produce. Also, the data in the stored_data folder can be unpickled to jump straight into analyzing it rather than having to collect, structure, and sort it prior to analysis if desired.
Part 2 will unpickle the data so that linguistic analyses can be done over the synopsis for each book.
